I have a degree in the Recording Arts and Sciences, a degree in Peace Studies, and I am now an aspiring graduate for the Thinkful Web-development Program.  I like to spend extended amounts of time in the outdoors.  I also very much like to spend time at home with my partner, family, and close friends.  Although I have a variety of skill sets and I have held many different jobs in my adult life, Web Development is actually the perfect career for a person like me.  It gives me an opportunity to solve problems through real-world solutions.  I aspire to make the world a better place and development is an excellent way to apply technical solutions to business, social, environmental, and almost any other problem.";
